\section{Web technologies}
\firstword{I}{n}
today's digital landscape, web technologies play a pivotal role in determining the performance and overall user experience of modern websites.
As the internet continues to evolve and user expectations rise, it becomes increasingly crucial to understand the profound impact
that these technologies have on Page Load Times (PLTs) for commercial and institutional websites.\\
This report aims to delve into various aspects of web technologies,
exploring their effects on PLTs and providing valuable insights to optimize website performance.

\subsection{Impact of parallel connections on PLTs}
\subsubsection*{Analyze and discuss the impacts of the number of parallel connections set inside the browser
  on the Page Load Times of commercial/institutional websites. Did you notice any expected or
  unexpected behavior?}
The impact of increasing the number of connections on page loading time is evident and consistent, as depicted in Figure \ref{fig-1}.
Experimental results clearly demonstrate that as the number of connections increases, the loading time consistently decreases,
showcasing the advantage of parallel downloading.
This effect can be attributed to the browser's ability to simultaneously download multiple files, resulting in an overall improvement in download speed.\\
However, it's important to note that the relationship between the number of connections and loading time is influenced by the size of the webpage.
For smaller page sizes, exemplified by the website \textit{www.pedranzini.it/}, the loading time remains relatively consistent regardless
of the number of connections. This suggests that the page can be efficiently loaded with a limited number of connections due to its compact size.
The downloading process for such pages is optimized, and further increasing the number of connections does not significantly impact the loading time.\\
Conversely, for larger page sizes, such as the case of \textit{www.vallespluga.it/}, the loading time exhibits a significant decrease as
the number of connections increases. This indicates that the page benefits from parallel connections to efficiently download its extensive content.
As the page size increases, the impact of parallel connections on reducing loading time becomes more pronounced.\\
To provide additional context, the table below presents the websites used for the analysis, along with their respective characteristics.

\subsection{Impact of caching policies on PLTs}
\subsubsection*{Analyze and discuss the impacts of caching policies implemented by different
  commercial/institutional websites on the Page Load Times. Consider websites that support
  HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 (possibly with unsecure and secure connections). Did you notice
  any expected or unexpected behavior?}

To provide a comprehensive understanding, an extensive analysis was conducted on multiple websites with varying characteristics, as presented in Table \ref{tab-2}.
Thorough testing was ensured by evaluating sites that supported multiple versions of the HTTP protocol with each version.\\
Upon examining the results depicted in Figure \ref{fig-2}, a noteworthy observation emerges: websites supporting HTTP/2 or HTTP/3
consistently exhibit faster loading times compared to those supporting only HTTP/1.1, regardless of the implemented cache policy.
This finding underscores the undeniable performance benefits associated with the adoption of newer HTTP protocol versions.\\
Furthermore, the analysis sheds light on the impact of different cache policies.
Websites supporting both validation and expiration cache policies were found to have shorter loading times compared to those supporting only the validation policy.
This outcome can be attributed to the combined advantages of validating cached content and leveraging expiration times to minimize server requests.
In contrast, websites lacking any caching mechanism displayed higher Page Load Times (PLTs),
underscoring the crucial role of effective caching in optimizing web performance.\\
Considering that page load time is significantly influenced by page size, and the analyzed pages vary in size,
the values displayed in Figure \ref{fig-2} have been normalized accordingly.
Additionally, it is important to note that the analyzed sites contain objects served by different servers,
resulting in requests using different versions of HTTP and cache policies. To address this issue,
each site was assigned the most commonly used HTTP cache policy and protocol.

\subsection{Performance analisys using  Apache HTTP server benchmarking tool}
Ab (ApacheBench), it is a command-line tool that comes bundled with the Apache HTTP Server.
It is designed to perform load testing and measure the performance of web servers.
The "ab" tool allows users to simulate multiple concurrent requests to a web server and record various performance metrics,
such as requests per second, latency, and throughput.
Below an example of the command used to perform the analysis, where the number of concurrent connections is set to 2 and the number of requests to 30.
\begin{lstlisting}
  ab -c 2 -n 30 www.galbusera.it/chi-siamo/
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection*{Analyze and discuss the performance of different commercial/institutional websites obtained
  under different conditions using the ab – Apache HTTP server benchmarking tool. Did you
  notice any expected or unexpected behavior?}
The websites listed in Table \ref{tab-3} were subjected to analysis using the 'ab' command to evaluate their performance under different conditions.
Specifically, the impact of concurrency level on requests per second and transfer rate was assessed, as depicted in Figure \ref*{fig-3} and \ref*{fig-4} respectively.
The results indicate that increasing the concurrency level leads to higher requests per second and transfer rate,
aligning with the findings discussed in Section 1.a, where an increase in the number of connections resulted in decreased page load time.\\
However, there were some unexpected results observed for certain websites. For instance, \textit{www.galbusera.it/chi-siamo/}
exhibited a slight decrease in transfer rate and requests per second when transitioning from 4 to 8 connections.
This anomaly could be attributed to factors like server congestion or limited network bandwidth at 8 connections.
However, with 16 connections, network congestion might be alleviated, potentially improving performance.
Alternatively, the website's server infrastructure might incorporate load balancing mechanisms that distribute requests evenly across
a limited number of resources, causing a slight decrease in performance with 4 to 8 connections but optimizing resource allocation with 16 connections.\\
Another anomalous finding was observed for \textit{www.pedranzini.it/}, which displayed a significantly higher number of
requests per second compared to other websites but a lower transfer rate. This outcome can be attributed to the smaller size of the website,
resulting in a higher number of requests per second despite the server's relatively lower performance in terms of transfer rate.\\
\noindent
To gain further insights, an additional analysis was conducted to evaluate the time distribution across the connecting, processing, and waiting phases,
as depicted in Figure \ref*{fig-5}.
The results illustrate that the time spent on the connection phase is relatively minimal when compared to the time allocated to processing and waiting.\\
The graphs clearly demonstrate that the majority of time is dedicated to processing the request on the server and waiting for the necessary operations to be completed.
This observation highlights the significance of server-side computations and any external dependencies involved in generating the response.
The processing phase, which encompasses executing server-side scripts, performing database queries,
or conducting complex computations, typically consumes a substantial portion of the overall time.\\
Intriguingly, the waiting time, during which the server may be accessing external resources or performing additional computations
before generating the complete response, is found to be lower than the processing time. This suggests that the waiting phase is generally efficient,
possibly due to optimized resource access or caching mechanisms employed by the server.
