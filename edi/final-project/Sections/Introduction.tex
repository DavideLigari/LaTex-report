\section{Introduction}
	In recent years, cyberattacks targeting network infrastructures have become increasingly prevalent and sophisticated.
	Among these attacks, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks pose a significant threat, causing disruptions and impairing the availability of online services.\\
	One specific type of DDoS attack is the DNS reflection and amplification attack, which leverages vulnerabilities in the DNS protocol
	to amplify the volume of attack traffic.
	These attacks not only compromise the targeted systems but also pose a risk to the overall stability of the Internet.
	So, it is crucial to understand the impact of such attacks, evaluate network resilience, and identify potential countermeasures.\\
	The objective of this study is to assess the impact of a DNS reflection and amplification attack by making spoofed requests to a laptop acting as a DNS server within a local network, while another laptop poses as the target of the attack.\\ 
    By simulating realistic attack scenarios, this research aims to uncover vulnerabilities within the DNS protocol and evaluate the effectiveness 
    of various countermeasures.
