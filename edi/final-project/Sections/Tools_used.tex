\section{Tools used}
\subsubsection*{Ping}
Ping is a network utility tool used to test the connectivity between two networked devices.
It sends a small packet of data to a specific IP address or hostname and measures the time it takes for that packet to be received and returned.
The result shows the round trip time (RTT), as well as the number of packets sent and received, and any packet loss that may have occurred.

\subsubsection*{Dig}
The dig command (short for "domain information groper") is a popular network administration tool used to perform DNS queries.
It allows users to perform DNS lookups to check DNS records and obtain information about DNS configurations.
It is a versatile tool that allows users to specify different query types, such as A, AAAA, MX, TXT, and others.

\subsubsection*{Top}
The top command provides real-time monitoring of system resources, such as CPU usage, memory utilization, running processes, and more.
When executed, the top command displays an interactive, dynamic table that continually updates, allowing users to view
the current state of their system and identify any processes consuming excessive resources.

\subsubsection*{Wireshark}
Wireshark is a open-source network protocol analyzer.
It is designed to capture, analyze, and display network traffic in real-time.
Wireshark allows users to inspect and interpret the data packets transmitted over a network, providing detailed information
about the communication between different devices.
